Objective:
The primary goal was to transition from static web design to dynamic functionality. Specifically, for the Calculator project, the objective was to build a responsive, browser-based tool capable of processing mathematical operations in real-time.

Steps PerformedStructural Foundation: 
Wrote semantic HTML5 to define the calculator's layout, including the display screen and a grid of interactive buttons.

Visual Styling: 
Applied CSS3 using a grid layout (display: grid) for button alignment, added hover effects for interactivity, and ensured a clean, modern UI.

Logical Implementation: 
Developed the core functionality using JavaScript. This involved:Capturing button clicks via event listeners.Handling basic arithmetic ($+$, $-$, $*$, $/$) and advanced operations like square roots ($\sqrt{}$).Implementing a "Clear" and "Delete" function for user error correction.Testing: Verified calculations within a browser environment to ensure accuracy and responsiveness.Tools UsedEditor: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for writing and debugging code.

Languages: HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+).

Environment: 
Modern web browser for live rendering and testing.OutcomeI successfully delivered a fully functional, mobile-responsive calculator that handles complex expressions and provides immediate feedback to the user.
